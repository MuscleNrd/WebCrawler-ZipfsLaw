# WebCrawler-ZipfsLaw

CS 4990 Project in which we created a webcrawler and using the results of the words found through dozens of pages,
rank the words and compare if they are similiar to zipfs law, which, in all cases they were.

The project also includes in-house crappy ROBOTS.txt rule obedience.

Open WebCrawler.java and set the amount of maximum links to gather, and the domains to crawl.
